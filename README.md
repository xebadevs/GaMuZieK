## Justification

This project captures the process of ***designing*** a Mobile Site with the UI/UX techniques learned in the course:

> Complete Web & Mobile Designer in 2022: UI/UX, Figma, +more

dictated by Andrei Neagoie and Daniel Schifano in `Zero to Mastery Academy`.

<br>

I felt the neccesity to enhance my UX/UI skills in order to create better designs and user experiences.

<br>


## Organization

I'll show the results in chronology order (if you're anxious or just want to see the final results, you can skip to the bottom).

This repository contains the following structure:

- Sketching
- User flow
- Sitemap
- Wireframe
- Prototype
- Typography
- Color
- Visual assets
- Motion
- Design system
- Final composition

If you want a more detailed view, you can open any of the repository files using `Figma`.

## 1. Sketching

Getting a first aproximation to the vague idea of a sales site:

> Many projects start simply by drawing a few lines on a blank space.

<br>


## 2. User flow

It includes some specifications about the behavior of the different sections and components.

First approximation:

Second aproximation, with major detail and design elements:

<br>


## 3. Sitemap

A truly pragmatic overview of the main sections, components and actions of the site:

<br>


## 4. Wireframe

The design begins to take a better and more defined shape.

It is highly recommended and useful to use different grids to put the interior elements and components in a more precise location:

<br>


## 5. Prototype

Preserving what has already been done in the wireframe, some sections and elements that the website should contain are added:

## 6. Typography

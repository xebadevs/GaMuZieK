## Justification

This project captures the process of ***designing*** a Mobile Site with the UI/UX techniques learned in the course:

> Complete Web & Mobile Designer in 2022: UI/UX, Figma, +more

dictated by Andrei Neagoie and Daniel Schifano in `Zero to Mastery Academy`.

<br>

I felt the neccesity to enhance my UX/UI skills in order to create better designs and user experiences.

<br>


## Organization

I'll show the results in chronology order (if you're anxious or just want to see the final results, you can skip to the bottom).

This repository contains the following structure:

- Sketching
- User flow
- Sitemap
- Wireframe
- Prototype
- Typography
- Color
- Visual assets
- Motion
- Design system
- Final composition

If you want a more detailed view, you can open any of the repository files using `Figma`.

## 1. Sketching

Getting a first aproximation to the vague idea of a sales site:

> Many projects start simply by drawing a few lines on a blank space.

<br>


## 2. User flow

It includes some specifications about the behavior of the different sections and components.

First approximation:

Second aproximation, with major detail and design elements:

<br>


## 3. Sitemap

A truly pragmatic overview of the main sections, components and actions of the site:

![03_sitemap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91569646/152528869-788bb5d4-fe51-4a03-96d2-32af96ba47ed.jpg)

<br>


## 4. Wireframe

The design begins to take a better and more defined shape.

It is highly recommended and useful to use different grids to put the interior elements and components in a more precise location:

<br>


## 5. Prototype

Preserving what has already been done in the wireframe, some sections and elements that the website should contain are added:

![05_prototype](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91569646/152531201-f0344a8e-5063-494c-bf67-244902b4e0c5.jpg)

<br>


## 6. Typography

A well-applied typeface can make a notable difference in quality and reinforce the style and meaning of a project.

Here I expose a comparison, a before and after in different elements.

In later stages there are also some typographical variations:

![06_typography](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91569646/152535573-eb365c31-288c-436a-8b7e-4c3177fd1889.jpg)

<br>


## 7. Color

As John Sterling said:

> Colors answer feeling in man; shapes answer thought; and motion answers will.

In this case, I defined a palette of primary colors as the first reference of the style.

You will see that the application is minor, but this pushed me later to considerable improvements.

Some examples:

![07_color](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91569646/152538392-669e5366-56e0-4821-ac2a-37c8fbb9ff87.jpg)

<br>


## Visual Assets

When I started inserting some images and icons, something didn't feel right, it didn't fit. The colored elements were distant from each other and did not generate any emotional effect.

Taking the color of the minor details to a leading place generated a total change in the style of the project:

![08_visual_assets](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91569646/152541245-4115580e-c03a-47d4-8242-5ceeabf3b18d.jpg)

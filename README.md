## Justification

This project captures the process of ***designing*** a Mobile Site with the UI/UX techniques learned in the course:

> Complete Web & Mobile Designer in 2022: UI/UX, Figma, +more

dictated by Andrei Neagoie and Daniel Schifano in `Zero to Mastery Academy`.

<br>

I felt the neccesity to enhance my UX/UI skills in order to create better designs and user experiences.

## Justification

This project captures the process of ***designing*** a Mobile Site with the UI/UX techniques learned in the course:

> Complete Web & Mobile Designer in 2022: UI/UX, Figma, +more

dictated by Andrei Neagoie and Daniel Schifano in `Zero to Mastery Academy`.

<br>

I felt the neccesity to enhance my UX/UI skills in order to create better designs and user experiences.

<br>


## Organization

I'll show the results in chronology order (if you're anxious or just want to see the final results, you can skip to the bottom).

This repository contains the following structure:

1. Setching
2. User flow
3. Sitemap
4. Wireframe
5. Prototype
6. Typography
7. Color
8. Visual assets
9. Motion
10. Design system
11. Final composition

If you want a more detailed view, you can open any of the repository files using `Figma`. 

<br>


## 1. Sketching

Getting a first aproximation to the vague idea of a sales site:

![01_sketching](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91569646/152446051-2a75d918-c1f1-4e55-9a8c-bf68951cceec.jpg)

> Many projects start simply by drawing a few lines on a blank space.

<br>


## 2. User flow

It includes some specifications about the behavior of the different sections and components.

First approximation:

![02_user_flow_a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91569646/152526116-c3e91adb-2917-4d5e-9626-1c0494f49d70.jpg)

Second aproximation, with major detail and design elements:

![02_user_flow_b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91569646/152528473-856f4417-8f6f-467d-a7ff-6d9c1e919188.jpg)

<br>


## 3. Sitemap

A truly pragmatic overview of the main sections, components and actions of the site:

![03_sitemap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91569646/152528869-788bb5d4-fe51-4a03-96d2-32af96ba47ed.jpg)

<br>


## 4. Wireframe

The design begins to take a better and more defined shape.

It is highly recommended and useful to use different grids to put the interior elements and components in a more precise location:

![04_wireframe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91569646/152448431-9e8dd684-0aa8-4c28-80c7-410ccc67936a.jpg)

<br>


## 5. Prototype

Preserving what has already been done in the wireframe, some sections and elements that the website should contain are added:

![05_prototype](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91569646/152531201-f0344a8e-5063-494c-bf67-244902b4e0c5.jpg)

<br>


## 6. Typography

A well-applied typeface can make a notable difference in quality and reinforce the style and meaning of a project.

Here I expose a comparison, a before and after in different elements.

In later stages there are also some typographical variations:

![06_typography](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91569646/152535573-eb365c31-288c-436a-8b7e-4c3177fd1889.jpg)

<br>


## 7. Color

As John Sterling said:

> Colors answer feeling in man; shapes answer thought; and motion answers will.

In this case, I defined a palette of primary colors as the first reference of the style.

You will see that the application is minor, but this pushed me later to considerable improvements.

Some examples:

![07_color](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91569646/152538392-669e5366-56e0-4821-ac2a-37c8fbb9ff87.jpg)

<br>


## 8. Visual Assets

When I started inserting some images and icons, something didn't feel right, it didn't fit. The colored elements were distant from each other and did not generate a significant enough emotional effect.
And buying something is an emotional event!

The style ***HAD*** to change.

Bringing the color of the small details to a leading place generated a total change in the style of the project and a much more significant effect:

![08_visual_assets](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91569646/152541245-4115580e-c03a-47d4-8242-5ceeabf3b18d.jpg)

<br>


## 9. Motion

To see some motions that I have implemented, you can open the corresponding file using Figma (you just need to create an account, it is free to use).

<br>


## 10. Design system

A design system in this context means the modularization of the project: the creation of components based on all the elements: icons, typography, buttons, inputs, containers, backgrounds, colors, etc.

This brings important conveniences and also provides greater consistency to the product:

![10_design_system](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91569646/152547450-1fda6444-5392-4e80-9511-84b094f5e03b.jpg)

<br>


## 10Â½. A brief timeline

I will take two sections: Start and Confirm products, and show their transformation from the initial to the final state:

<br>

## Comments

This project has become a conscious way to delve into the origins of a design, following the best recommended practices to obtain a quality product.

It represents for me a highly valuable precedent that I will undoubtedly include in my participation in the following projects.
